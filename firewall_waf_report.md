## 1. Introduction to Firewalls

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

### 1.2 Types of Firewalls

#### 1.2.1 Network-Based Firewalls
- **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** Examine packets at the network layer, filtering based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols
- **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** Track the state of active connections and make decisions based on context
- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW):** Combine traditional firewall capabilities with advanced features like application awareness and intrusion prevention

#### 1.2.2 Host-Based Firewalls
- Software-based firewalls installed on individual devices
- Provide granular control over applications and processes
- Essential for endpoint protection

### 1.3 Firewall Architecture

#### 1.3.1 Network Topology Considerations
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** Segregated network segment for public-facing services
- **Internal Network Segmentation:** Dividing internal networks based on security requirements
- **Multi-Layer Defense:** Implementing firewalls at multiple network layers

#### 1.3.2 Rule Configuration
- Default deny policy implementation
- Least privilege principle
- Regular rule review and optimization
- Documentation and change management

## 2. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Fundamentals

### 2.1 Definition and Scope

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security solution that protects web applications by filtering, monitoring, and blocking HTTP/HTTPS traffic between web applications and the internet. Unlike traditional firewalls that operate at network layers, WAFs function at the application layer (Layer 7).

### 2.2 WAF Deployment Models

#### 2.2.1 Network-Based WAF
- Hardware appliances deployed in the network infrastructure
- High performance and low latency
- Requires significant upfront investment

#### 2.2.2 Host-Based WAF
- Software installed on web servers
- Deep integration with applications
- Resource consumption considerations

#### 2.2.3 Cloud-Based WAF
- Delivered as a service through cloud providers
- Scalable and cost-effective
- Reduced maintenance overhead

### 2.3 WAF Protection Mechanisms

#### 2.3.1 Signature-Based Detection
- Pre-defined attack patterns and signatures
- Protection against known vulnerabilities
- Regular signature updates required

#### 2.3.2 Behavioral Analysis
- Machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies
- Zero-day attack protection
- Adaptive threat detection capabilities

#### 2.3.3 Positive Security Model
- Whitelist approach allowing only legitimate traffic
- Highly secure but requires extensive configuration
- Suitable for stable applications

#### 2.3.4 Negative Security Model
- Blacklist approach blocking known malicious patterns
- Easier to implement and maintain
- May miss novel attack vectors

### 2.4 Common Web Application Threats Mitigated by WAF

- **SQL Injection:** Preventing malicious SQL commands
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Blocking script injection attacks
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Preventing unauthorized requests
- **DDoS Attacks:** Rate limiting and traffic filtering
- **Data Leakage:** Monitoring and preventing sensitive data exposure
